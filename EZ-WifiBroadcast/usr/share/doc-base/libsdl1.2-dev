Title: SDL Documentation
Author: Sam Lantinga <slouken@libsdl.org>
Abstract: The SDL library is designed to make it easy to write games that
 run on Linux, Win32 and BeOS using the various native high-performance media
 interfaces, (for video, audio, etc) and presenting a single source-code level
 API to your application. This is a fairly low level API, but using this,
 completely portable applications can be written with a great deal of
 flexibility.
