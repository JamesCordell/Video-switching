bash-completion for Debian
--------------------------

 Completions are kept in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions.

 /etc/bash_completion.d/ is being kept for compatibility reasons; but will
 disappear in future. If you're a package maintainer, you're encouraged to
 use dh_bash-completion(1), which will take care of installing third-party
 completions into the appropriate directory.
