inputattach for Debian
----------------------

This package does not include an initscript to initialize your
devices automatically; it isn't possible to adequately control
inputattach as would be required for an initscript.

To automatically attach a serial device to the input layer, the
recommended approach is simply to add the appropriate lines to
/etc/rc.local, or to a local udev rules file. For example, to
configure a Mouse Systems mouse on the first serial port:
 * in /etc/rc.local
	inputattach --daemon -msc /dev/ttyS0
 * or in /etc/udev/010_local.rules
	ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="ttyS0", RUN+="/lib/udev/inputattach --daemon -msc /dev/%k"
The udev rule uses the provided inputattach agent to wait until
inputattach becomes available before attempting to run it.

This package includes udev rules to automatically attach Wacom W8001
devices on Fujitsu T2010 or Lenovo X200-series laptops and tablets.
These rules conflict with versions of xserver-xorg-wacom matching WACf
or FUJ02e5 in a MatchProduct line; to use the tablets with
inputattach, the matching identifiers in the MatchProduct line must be
removed so that the evdev driver is used in X.org.
