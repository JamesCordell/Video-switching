automake-1.14 for Debian
----------------------

Automake 1.14 introduces several changes. It is not strictly backwards
compatible with previous versions of automake before 1.13. It must be used in
conjunction with autoconf 2.65 or greater. Using it with a earlier
version will generate broken Makefiles. Also, it no longer invokes
libtoolize. This job has fallen upon the autoconf utility
`autoreconf'.
