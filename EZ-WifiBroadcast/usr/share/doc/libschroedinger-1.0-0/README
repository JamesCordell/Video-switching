Schroedinger
============

Schroedinger (or "schro" for short) is an implementation of the
Dirac and SMPTE VC-2 video compression specification.  Dirac was
developed by BBC Research & Development (http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/)
as an open technology with open licensing.


Schroedinger is the C library implementing video encoding and
decoding.  Most end users will want to use an application that
uses the Schroedinger library for encoding and decoding Dirac
streams.  A few such applications are Totem, VLC, and Mplayer.
In addition, media frameworks such as GStreamer and decoding
libraries such as ffmpeg can be configured to use Schroedinger
either internally or via plugins.


Schroedinger requires Orc (the Oil Runtime Compiler) in order to
processing.  Orc is a library that generates SIMD code at runtime
based on simple rules and configurable parameters.  Information
about Orc can be found here:

Schroedinger uses pkg-config both for finding Orc, and for allowing
other build systems to find it.  If you are having trouble with
configure scripts not finding Orc or Schroedinger, you probably need
to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable (substitute /usr/local
as necessary):

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig


Schroedinger has a mailing list:

  (Note that this is spelled with just an "o" instead of "oe" or
   o-umlaut "รถ".)
