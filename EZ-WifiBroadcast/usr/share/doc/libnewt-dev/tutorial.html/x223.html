>Components are the basic user interface element <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> provides. A
single component may be (for example) a listbox, push button checkbox,
a collection of other components. Most components are used to display
information in a window, provide a place for the user to enter data, or a
combination of these two functions. 

Forms, however, are a component whose primary purpose is not noticed by
the user at all. Forms are collections of components (a form may contain
another form) which logically relate the components to one another. Once
a form is created and had all of its constituent components added to it,
applications normally then run the form.  This gives control of the
application to the form, which then lets the user enter data onto the
form. When the user is done (a number of different events qualify as
``done''), the form returns control to the part of the application which
invoked it. The application may then read the information the user provided
and continue appropriately.

All <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> components are stored in a common data type, a
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtComponent</TT
> (some of the particulars of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtComponent</TT
>s have
already been mentioned. While this makes it easy for programmers to pass
components around, it does force them to make sure they don't pass
entry boxes to routines expecting push buttons, as the compiler can't
ensure that for them.

We start off with a brief introduction to forms. While not terribly
complete, this introduction is enough to let us illustrate the rest of
the components with some sample code. We'll then discuss the remainder of
the components, and end this section with a more exhaustive description of
forms.</P
><DIV
CLASS="SECT2"
><H2
CLASS="SECT2"
><A
NAME="AEN230"
>Introduction to Forms</A
></H2
><P
>As we've mentioned, forms are simply collections of components. As only one
form can be active (or running) at a time, every component which the user
should be able to access must be on the running form (or on a subform of
the running form). A form is itself a component, which means forms are
stored in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtComponent</TT
> data structures.


<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>newtComponent newtForm(newtComponent vertBar, const char * help, int flags);</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>


To create a form, call <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtForm()</TT
>. The first parameter is a vertical
scrollbar which should be associated with the form. For now, that should
always be <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
> (we'll discuss how to create scrolling forms later in
this section). The second parameter, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>help</TT
>, is currently unused and
should always be <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
>. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>flags</TT
> is normally 0, and other values
it can take will be discussed later. Now that we've waved away the
complexity of this function, creating a form boils down to simply:


<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>newtComponent myForm;

myForm = newtForm(NULL, NULL, 0);</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>


After a form is created, components need to be added to it --- after all,
an empty form isn't terribly useful. There are two functions which add
components to a form.


<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>void newtFormAddComponent(newtComponent form, newtComponent co);
void newtFormAddComponents(newtComponent form, ...);</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>


The first function, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtFormAddComponent()</TT
>, adds a single component
to the form which is passed as the first parameter. The second function
is simply a convenience function. After passing the form to
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtFormAddComponents()</TT
>, an arbitrary number of components is then
passed, followed by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
>. Every component passed is added to the form.

Once a form has been created and components have been added to it, it's
time to run the form.


<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>newtComponent newtRunForm(newtComponent form);</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>


This function runs the form passed to it, and returns the component which
caused the form to stop running. For now, we'll ignore the return value
completely.

Notice that this function doesn't fit in with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
>'s normal
naming convention. It is an older interface which will not work for all
forms. It was left in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> only for legacy applications. It is a
simpler interface than the new <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtFormRun()</TT
> though, and is still used
quite often as a result.

When an application is done with a form, it destroys the form and
all of the components the form contains.


<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>void newtFormDestroy(newtComponent form);	</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>


This function frees the memory resources used by the form and all of the
components which have been added to the form (including those components
which are on subforms). Once a form has been destroyed, none of the form's
components can be used.</P

CLASS="SECT2"

>There are a couple of functions which work on more then one type of
components. The description of each component indicates which (if any)
of these functions are valid for that particular component.

void newtComponentAddCallback(newtComponent co, newtCallback f, void * data);
void newtComponentTakesFocus(newtComponent co, int val);</PRE

></TABLE
>


The first registers a callback function for that component. A callback
function is a function the application provides which <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> calls for a
particular component. Exactly when (if ever) the callback is invoked
depends on the type of component the callback is attached to, and will be
discussed for the components which support callbacks.

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtComponentTakesFocus()</TT
> works on all components. It allows the
application to change which components the user is allowed to select as the
current component, and hence provide input to. Components which do not
take focus are skipped over during form traversal, but they are displayed
on the terminal. Some components should never be set to take focus, such
as those which display static text.</P

>Nearly all forms contain at least one button. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Newt</TT

flavors, full buttons and compact buttons. Full buttons take up quit a bit
of screen space, but look much better then the single-row compact buttons.
Other then their size, both button styles behave identically. Different
functions are used to create the two types of buttons.

Both functions take identical parameters. The first two parameters are the
location of the upper left corner of the button, and the final parameter is
the text which should be displayed in the button (such as ``Ok'' or
``Cancel'').</P

Creating a label is just like creating a button; just pass the location of
the label and the text it should display. Unlike buttons, labels do let the
application change the text in the label with <TT

the label's text is changed, the label automatically redraws itself. It
does not clear out any old text which may be leftover from the previous

if the box should start off empty. Next, the width of the physical box is
given. This width may or may not limit the length of the string the user is
allowed to enter; that depends on the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>flags</TT
>. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>resultPtr</TT
> must
be the address of a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>char *</TT
>. Until the entry box is destroyed by
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtFormDestroy()</TT
>, that <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>char *</TT
> will point to the current value
of the entry box. It's important that applications make a copy of that
value before destroying the form if they need to use it later. The
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>resultPtr</TT
> may be <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
>, in which case the user must use the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtEntryGetValue()</TT
> function to get the value of the entry box.

Entry boxes support a number of flags:

<P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>NEWT_ENTRY_SCROLL</DT
><DD
><P
>If this flag is not specified, the user cannot
enter text into the entry box which is wider then the entry box itself.
This flag removes this limitation, and lets the user enter data of an
arbitrary length.</P
></DD
><DT
>NEWT_FLAG_HIDDEN</DT
><DD
><P
>If this flag is specified, the value of the entry box
is not displayed. This is useful when the application needs to read a
password, for example.</P
></DD
><DT
>NEWT_FLAG_RETURNEXIT</DT
><DD
><P
>When this flag is given, the entry box will cause
the form to stop running if the user pressed return inside of the entry
box. This can provide a nice shortcut for users.</P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
>


After an entry box has been created, its contents can be set by
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtEntrySet()</TT
>. After the entry box itself, the new string to place
in the entry box is passed. The final parameter, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cursorAtEnd</TT
>, controls
where the cursor will appear in the entry box. If it is zero, the cursor
remains at its present location; a nonzero value moves the cursor to the
end of the entry box's new value.

While the simplest way to find the value of an entry box is by using a
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>resultPtr</TT
>, doing so complicates some applications.
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtEntryGetValue()</TT
> returns a pointer to the string which the entry
box currently contains. The returned pointer may not be valid once the
user further modifies the entry box, and will not be valid after the 
entry box has been destroyed, so be sure to save its value in a more
permanent location if necessary.

Entry boxes allow applications to filter characters as they are entered.
This allows programs to ignore characters which are invalid (such as
entering a ^ in the middle of a phone number) and provide intelligent aids
to the user (such as automatically adding a '.' after the user has typed in
the first three numbers in an IP address). 

When a filter is registered through <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtEntrySetFilter()</TT
>, both the
filter itself and an arbitrary <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>void *</TT
>, which passed to the filter
whenever it is invoked, are recorded. This data pointer isn't used for any
other purpose, and may be <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
>. Entry filters take four arguments.


<P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>The entry box which had data entered into it</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The data pointer which was registered along with the filter</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The new character which <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> is considering inserting into the
entry box</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The current cursor position (0 is the leftmost position)</P
></LI
></OL
>

The filter returns 0 if the character should be ignored, or the value of
the character which should be inserted into the entry box. Filter functions
which want to do complex manipulations of the string should use
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtEntrySet()</TT
> to update the entry box and then return 0 to prevent
the new character from being inserted.

When a callback is attached to a entry box, the callback is invoked
whenever the user moves off of the callback and on to another component.

Here is a sample program which illustrates the use of both labels and
entry boxes.

Each item in the sequence is a single character, and the sequence itself is

>When applications need to display large amounts of text, it's common not to
know exactly where the linebreaks should go. While textboxes are quite
willing to scroll the text, the programmer still must know what width the
text will look ``best'' at (where ``best'' means most exactly rectangular;
no lines much shorter or much longer then the rest). This common is
especially prevalent in internationalized programs, which need to make a
wide variety of message string look god on a screen.

To help with this, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> provides routines to reformat text to look
good. It tries different widths to figure out which one will look ``best''
to the user. As these commons are almost always used to format text for
textbox components, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

reflowed text.

The <TT

to the width of the longest line and the number of lines in in the
returned text, respectively. Either one may be <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
>. The return
value points to the reflowed text, and is allocated through <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>malloc()</TT
>.

When the reflowed text is being placed in a textbox it may be easier to use
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtTextboxReflowed()</TT
>, which creates a textbox, reflows the text, and
places the reflowed text in the listbox. It's parameters consist of the
position of the final textbox, the width and flex values for the text
(which are identical to the parameters passed to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtReflowText()</TT
>,
and the flags for the textbox (which are the same as the flags for
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtTextbox()</TT
>. This function does not let you limit the height of the
textbox, however, making limiting it's use to constructing textboxes which
don't need to scroll.

To find out how tall the textbox created by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtTextboxReflowed()</TT
> is, 
use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtTextboxGetNumLines()</TT
>, which returns the number of lines in the
textbox. For textboxes created by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtTextboxReflowed()</TT
>, this is
always the same as the height of the textbox.

Here's a simple program which uses a textbox to display a message.

When a scrollbar is created, it is given a position on the screen, a
height, and two colors. The first color is the color used for drawing the
scrollbar, and the second color is used for drawing the thumb. This is the
only place in newt where an application specifically sets colors for a
component. It's done here to let the colors a scrollbar use match the
colors of the component the scrollbar is mated too. When a scrollbar is
being used with a form, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>normalColorset</TT
> is often
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEWT_COLORSET_WINDOW</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEWT_COLORSET_ACTCHECKBOX</TT
>. Of course, feel free to peruse
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&lt;newt.h&gt;</TT

As the scrollbar is normally updated by the component it is mated with,
there is no public interface for moving the thumb.</P

>A listbox is created at a certain position and a given height. The
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>height</TT
> is used for two things. First of all, it is the minimum
height the listbox will use. If there are less items in the listbox then
the height, suggests the listbox will still take up that minimum amount
of space. Secondly, if the listbox is set to be scrollable (by setting
the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEWT_FLAG_SCROLL flag</TT
>, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>height</TT
> is also the maximum height
of the listbox. If the listbox may not scroll, it increases its height to
display all of its items.

The following flags may be used when creating a listbox:

<P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>NEWT_FLAG_SCROLL</DT
><DD
><P
>The listbox should scroll to display all of the

list, the form should return.</P
></DD

it easier to see which listbox has the focus when a form contains multiple
listboxes.</P
></DD

>NEWT_FLAG_MULTIPLE</DT

>By default, a listbox only lets the user select
one item in the list at a time. When this flag is specified, they may
select multiple items from the list.</P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
></P
><P
>Once a listbox has been created, items are added to it by invoking
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtListboxAppendEntry()</TT
>, which adds new items to the end of the list.
In addition to the listbox component, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtListboxAppendEntry()</TT
> needs
both elements of the (text, key) ordered pair. 

For lists which only allow a single selection, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtListboxGetCurrent()</TT
>
should be used to find out which listbox item is currently selected. It
returns the key of the currently selected item.

Normally, a listbox is as wide as its widest element, plus space for a
scrollbar if the listbox is supposed to have one. To make the listbox
any larger then that, use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtListboxSetWidth()</TT
>, which overrides the
natural list of the listbox. Once the width has been set, it's fixed. The
listbox will no longer grow to accommodate new entries, so bad things may
happen! 

An application can change the current position of the listbox (where the
selection bar is displayed) by calling <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtListboxSetCurrent()</TT
> or
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtListboxSetCurrentByKey()</TT
>. The first sets the current position to the
entry number which is passed as the second argument, with 0 indicating
the first entry. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtListboxSetCurrentByKey()</TT

to the entry whose <TT
