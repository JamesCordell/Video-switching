<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtInit()</TT
> should be the first function called by every <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
>
program. It initializes internal data structures and places the terminal
in raw mode. Most applications invoke <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtCls()</TT
> immediately after
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtInit()</TT
>, which causes the screen to be cleared. It's not
necessary to call <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtCls()</TT
> to use any of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
>'s features, but
doing so will normally give a much neater appearance.

When a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> program is ready to exit, it should call <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtFinished()</TT
>.

<TT

be moved to the bottom, but it won't be possible to remember the original
terminal contents) and places the terminal in its original input state.
If this function isn't called, the terminal will probably need to be
reset with the <TT

windows, just like the system's root directory is the parent of all 
subdirectories). Normally, applications don't use the root window, instead
drawing all of their text inside of windows (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> doesn't require
this though -- widgets may be placed directly on the root window without
difficulty). It is often desirable to display some text, such as a
program's name or copyright information, on the root window, however.
<TT

functions may be called at any time. They are the only <TT

>This function is straightforward. It displays the string <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>text</TT
> at
the position indicated. If either the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>left</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>top</TT
> is
negative, the position is measured from the opposite side of the
screen. The final measurement will seem to be off by one though. For
example, a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>top</TT
> of -1 indicates the last line on the screen, and
one of -2 is the line above that.

As it's common to use the last line on the screen to display help information,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> includes special support for doing exactly that. The last
line on the display is known as the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>help line</I
></SPAN
>, and is treated as a
stack. As the value of the help line normally relates to the window
currently displayed, using the same structure for window order and the
help line is very natural. Two functions are provided to manipulate the
help line.


<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"

><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>void newtPushHelpLine(const char * text);
void newtPopHelpLine(void);</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>


The first function, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtPushHelpLine()</TT
>, saves the current help line
on a stack (which is independent of the window stack) and displays the
new line. If <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>text</TT
> is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
>'s default help line is
displayed (which provides basic instructions on using <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
>). If
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>text</TT
> is a string of length 0, the help line is cleared. For all
other values of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>text</TT
>, the passed string is displayed at the bottom,
left-hand corner of the display. The space between the end of the displayed
string the the right-hand edge of the terminal is cleared.

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtPopHelpLine()</TT
> replaces the current help line with the one it
replaced. It's important not to call tt/newtPopHelpLine()/ more then
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtPushHelpLine()</TT
>!

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Suspending Newt Applications</TT
>

By default, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> programs cannot be suspended by the user (compare
this to most Unix programs which can be suspended by pressing the suspend
key (normally <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>^Z</TT
>).  Instead, programs can specify a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>callback</I
></SPAN
>
function which gets invoked when the user presses the suspend key. 


<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>typedef void (*newtSuspendCallback)(void);

void newtSetSuspendCallback(newtSuspendCallback cb);</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>


The suspend function neither expects nor returns any value, and can
do whatever it likes to when it is invoked. If no suspend callback
is registered, the suspend keystroke is ignored.

If the application should suspend and continue like most user applications,
the suspend callback needs two other <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> functions.


<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>void newtSuspend(void);
void newtResume(void);</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>


<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtSuspend()</TT
> tells <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> to return the terminal to its initial
state. Once this is done, the application can suspend itself (by
sending itself a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SIGTSTP</TT
>, fork a child program, or do whatever
else it likes. When it wants to resume using the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> interface,
it must call <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtResume</TT
> before doing so. 

Note that suspend callbacks are not signal handlers. When <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtInit()</TT
>
takes over the terminal, it disables the part of the terminal interface
which sends the suspend signal. Instead, if <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newt</TT
> sees the suspend
keystroke during normal input processing, it immediately calls the suspend
callback if one has been set. This means that suspending newt applications
is not asynchronous.</P

>To increase performance, S-Lang only updates the display when it needs
to, not when the program tells S-Lang to write to the terminal. ``When it
needs to'' is implemented as ``right before the we wait for the user to
press a key''. While this allows for optimized screen displays most of
the time, this optimization makes things difficult for programs which
want to display progress messages without forcing the user to input 
characters. Applications can force S-Lang to immediately update modified
portions of the screen by calling <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newtRefresh</TT
>.

The first sends a beep to the terminal. Depending on the terminal's
