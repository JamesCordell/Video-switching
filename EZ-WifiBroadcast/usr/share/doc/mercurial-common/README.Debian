Documentation
*************

Mercurial documentation is available on the web at:
   http://hgbook.red-bean.com/ and
   http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/

Extensions
**********

Extensions can be enabled system-wide, per-user and/or per repository (see
hgrc(5) for more information). Previous versions of this Debian package
enabled some extensions by default; however, this is no longer the case.

To enable extensions system-wide, you may edit the
/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/hgext.rc configuration file. This file also contains
information on the dependencies of each extension.


Emacs support
*************
This package installs a mercurial.el file in the example directory
(/usr/share/doc/mercurial/examples/). However, with emacs22 or better,
vc-hg.el provided directly by emacs is better. This is why mercurial.el
is not installed by default anymore.
