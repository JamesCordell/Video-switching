This part of the FAQ is based on a series of questions we asked the FSF
to understand how the GPL works and how patents affects the GPL. These
questions were answered by the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="_top">
FSF lawyers</a>, so we view them as the
final interpretation on how the GPL and LGPL interact with patents in our 
opinion. This consultancy was paid for by
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fluendo.com/" target="_top">Fluendo</a>
in order to obtain clear and quotable answers.  These answers were certified
by the FSF lawyer team and verified by FSF lawyer and law professor Eben Moglen.

This would be a problem, because the GStreamer and MyPlayer licenses would
forbid it.  In order to link GStreamer to MyPlayer, you need to use section
3 of the LGPL to convert GStreamer to GPL.  The GPL version of GStreamer
forbids linking to the Sorenson decoder.  Anyway, the MyPlayer GPL
license forbids this.  
        </p><p>
If the authors of MyPlayer want to permit this, we have an
exception for them: the controlled interface exception from the FAQ.
The idea of this is that you can't get around the GPL just by including
a LGPL bit in the middle.
        </p><p>
Note: MyPlayer is a completely fictituous application at the time of writing.

You may not distribute the plug-in with the GPL application. 
Distributing the plug-in alone, with the knowledge that it will be used
primarily by GPL software is a bit of an edge case.  We will not advise you
that it would be safe to do so, but we also will not advise you that it
would be absolutely forbidden.

This might infringe some patents, but the GPL would not forbid it 
absent some actual restriction, such as a court judgement or agreement.
The US government is empowered to refuse importation of patent
infringing devices, including software.

The mere existence of a patent which might read on the program does not
change anything. However, if a court judgement or other agreement
prevents you from distributing libmad under GPL terms, you can not
distribute it at all.
        </p><p>
The GPL and LGPL say (sections 7 and 11):
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.</span>”</span>

The GPL operates on a per-action, not per-program basis.  That is, if
you are in a country which has software patents, and a court tells you
that you cannot distribute (say) libmad in source code form, then you
cannot distribute libmad at all.  This doesn't affect anyone else.

The only GPL-compatible patent licenses are those which are open to  
all parties posessing copies of GPL software which practices the 
teachings of the patent.

If you take a license which doesn't allow others to distribute
original or modified versions of libmad practicing the same patent
claims as the version you distribute, then you may not distribute at
all.
