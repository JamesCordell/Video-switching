      Upstream negotiation's primary use is to renegotiate (part of) an
      already-negotiated pipeline to a new format. Some practical examples
      include to select a different video size because the size of the video
      window changed, and the video output itself is not capable of rescaling,
      or because the audio channel configuration changed.
    </p><p>
      Upstream caps renegotiation is requested by sending a GST_EVENT_RECONFIGURE
      event upstream. The idea is that it will instruct the upstream element
      to reconfigure its caps by doing a new query for the allowed caps and then
      choosing a new caps. The element that sends out the RECONFIGURE event
      would influence the selection of the new caps by returning the new
      preferred caps from its GST_QUERY_CAPS query function. The RECONFIGURE
      event will set the GST_PAD_FLAG_NEED_RECONFIGURE on all pads that it
      travels over.

      It is important to note here that different elements actually have
      different responsibilities here:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          Elements that want to propose a new format upstream need to first
          check if the new caps are acceptable upstream with an ACCEPT_CAPS
          query. Then they would send a RECONFIGURE event and be prepared to
          answer the CAPS query with the new preferred format. It should be
          noted that when there is no upstream element that can (or wants)
          to renegotiate, the element needs to deal with the currently
          configured format.

          event upstream. Because these elements simply do a fixed transform
          based on the upstream caps, they need to send the event upstream
          so that it can select a new format.

          These elements can't reconfigure and their output caps don't depend
          on the upstream caps so the event can be dropped.
