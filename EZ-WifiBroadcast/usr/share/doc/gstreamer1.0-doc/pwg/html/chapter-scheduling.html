    The scheduling mode of a pad defines how data is retrieved from (source)
    or given to (sink) pads. <span class="application">GStreamer</span> can operate in two scheduling
    mode, called push- and pull-mode. <span class="application">GStreamer</span> supports elements with pads
    in any of the scheduling modes where not all pads need to be operating
    in the same mode.
  </p><p>
    So far, we have only discussed <code class="function">_chain ()</code>-operating
    elements, i.e. elements that have a chain-function set on their sink pad
    and push buffers on their source pad(s). We call this the push-mode
    because a peer element will use <code class="function">gst_pad_push ()</code> on
    a srcpad, which will cause our <code class="function">_chain ()</code>-function
    to be called, which in turn causes our element to push out a buffer on
    the source pad. The initiative to start the dataflow happens somewhere
    upstream when it pushes out a buffer and all downstream elements get
    scheduled when their <code class="function">_chain ()</code>-functions are
    called in turn.
  </p><p>
    Before we explain pull-mode scheduling, let's first understand how the
    different scheduling modes are selected and activated on a pad.
  </p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section-scheduling-activation"></a>The pad activation stage</h2></div></div></div><p>
      During the element state change of READY-&gt;PAUSED, the pads of an
      element will be activated. This happens first on the source pads and
      then on the sink pads of the element. <span class="application">GStreamer</span> calls the
      <code class="function">_activate ()</code> of a pad. By default this function
      will activate the pad in push-mode by calling
      <code class="function">gst_pad_activate_mode ()</code> with the GST_PAD_MODE_PUSH
      scheduling mode.
      It is possible to override the <code class="function">_activate ()</code> of a pad
      and decide on a different scheduling mode. You can know in what
      scheduling mode a pad is activated by overriding the
      <code class="function">_activate_mode ()</code>-function.
    </p><p>
      <span class="application">GStreamer</span> allows the different pads of an element to operate in
      different scheduling modes. This allows for many different possible
      use-cases. What follows is an overview of some typical use-cases.
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          If all pads of an element are activated in push-mode scheduling,
          the element as a whole is operating in push-mode. 
          For source elements this means that they will have to start a
          task that pushes out buffers on the source pad to the downstream
          elements.
          Downstream elements will have data pushed to them by upstream elements
          using the sinkpads <code class="function">_chain ()</code>-function which will
          push out buffers on the source pads.
          Prerequisites for this scheduling mode are that a chain-function was
          set for each sinkpad using <code class="function">gst_pad_set_chain_function ()</code>
          and that all downstream elements operate in the same mode.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Alternatively, sinkpads can be the driving force behind a pipeline
          by operating in pull-mode, while the sourcepads
          of the element still operate in push-mode. In order to be the
          driving force, those pads start a <code class="classname">GstTask</code>
          when they are activated. This task is a thread, which
          will call a function specified by the element. When called, this
          function will have random data access (through
          <code class="function">gst_pad_pull_range ()</code>) over all sinkpads, and
          can push data over the sourcepads, which effectively means that
          this element controls data flow in the pipeline. Prerequisites for
          this mode are that all downstream elements can act in push
          mode, and that all upstream elements operate in pull-mode (see below).
        </p><p>
          Source pads can be activated in PULL mode by a downstream element
          when they return GST_PAD_MODE_PULL from the GST_QUERY_SCHEDULING
          query. Prerequisites for this scheduling mode are that a
          getrange-function was set for the source pad using
          <code class="function">gst_pad_set_getrange_function ()</code>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Lastly, all pads in an element can be activated in PULL-mode.
          However, contrary to the above, this does not mean that they
          start a task on their own. Rather, it means that they are pull
          slave for the downstream element, and have to provide random data
          access to it from their <code class="function">_get_range ()</code>-function.
          Requirements are that the a <code class="function">_get_range
          ()</code>-function was set on this pad using the function
          <code class="function">gst_pad_set_getrange_function ()</code>. Also, if
          the element has any sinkpads, all those pads (and thereby their
          peers) need to operate in PULL access mode, too.
        </p><p>
          When a sink element is activated in PULL mode, it should start a
          task that calls <code class="function">gst_pad_pull_range ()</code> on its
          sinkpad. It can only do this when the upstream SCHEDULING query
          returns support for the GST_PAD_MODE_PULL scheduling mode.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      In the next two sections, we will go closer into pull-mode scheduling
      (elements/pads driving the pipeline, and elements/pads providing random
      access), and some specific use cases will be given.
