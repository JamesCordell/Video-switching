      In this chapter follows a list of all defined events that are currently
      being used, plus how they should be used/interpreted. You can check the
      what type a certain event is using the GST_EVENT_TYPE macro (or if you
      need a string for debugging purposes you can use GST_EVENT_TYPE_NAME).
    </p><p>
      In this chapter, we will discuss the following events:

      For more comprehensive information about events and how they should be
      used correctly in various circumstances please consult the GStreamer
      design documentation. This section only gives a general overview.

      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-events-caps"></a>Caps</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The CAPS event contains the format description of the following
        buffers. See <a class="xref" href="chapter-negotiation.html" title="Chapter 14. Caps negotiation">Caps negotiation</a> for more
        information about negotiation.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-events-segment"></a>Segment</h3></div></div></div><p>
        A segment event is sent downstream to announce the range of valid
        timestamps in the stream and how they should be transformed into
        running-time and stream-time. A segment event must always be sent
        before the first buffer of data and after a flush (see above).
      </p><p>
        The first segment event is created by the element driving the 
        pipeline, like a source operating in push-mode or a demuxer/decoder
        operating pull-based. This segment event then travels down the
        pipeline and may be transformed on the way (a decoder, for example,
        might receive a segment event in BYTES format and might transform
        this into a segment event in TIMES format based on the average
        bitrate).
      </p><p>
        Depending on the element type, the event can simply be forwarded using
        <code class="function">gst_pad_event_default ()</code>, or it should be parsed
        and a modified event should be sent on. The last is true for demuxers,
        which generally have a byte-to-time conversion concept. Their input
        is usually byte-based, so the incoming event will have an offset in
        byte units (<span class="symbol">GST_FORMAT_BYTES</span>), too. Elements
        downstream, however, expect segment events in time units, so that
        it can be used to synchronize against the pipeline clock. Therefore,
        demuxers and similar elements should not forward the event, but parse
        it, free it and send a segment event (in time units,
        <span class="symbol">GST_FORMAT_TIME</span>) further downstream.
      </p><p>
        The segment event is created using the function
        <code class="function">gst_event_new_segment ()</code>. See the API
        reference and design document for details about its parameters. 
      </p><p>
        Elements parsing this event can use gst_event_parse_segment()
        to extract the event details. Elements may find the GstSegment
        API useful to keep track of the current segment (if they want to use
        it for output clipping, for example).
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-events-tag"></a>Tag (metadata)</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Tagging events are being sent downstream to indicate the tags as parsed
        from the stream data. This is currently used to preserve tags during
        stream transcoding from one format to the other. Tags are discussed
        extensively in <a class="xref" href="chapter-advanced-tagging.html" title="Chapter 22. Tagging (Metadata and Streaminfo)">Chapter 22, <i>Tagging (Metadata and Streaminfo)</i></a>. Most
        elements will simply forward the event by calling
        <code class="function">gst_pad_event_default ()</code>.
      </p><p>
        The tag event is created using the function
        <code class="function">gst_event_new_tag ()</code>, but more often elements will
        send a tag event downstream that will be converted into a message
        on the bus by sink elements.
        All of these functions require a filled-in taglist as
        argument, which they will take ownership of.
      </p><p>
        Elements parsing this event can use the function
        <code class="function">gst_event_parse_tag ()</code> to acquire the
        taglist that the event contains.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-events-eos"></a>End of Stream (EOS)</h3></div></div></div><p>
        End-of-stream events are sent if the stream that an element sends out
        is finished. An element receiving this event (from upstream, so it
        receives it on its sinkpad) will generally just process any buffered
        data (if there is any) and then forward the event further downstream.
        The <code class="function">gst_pad_event_default ()</code> takes care of all
        this, so most elements do not need to support this event. Exceptions are
        elements that explicitly need to close a resource down on EOS, and
        N-to-1 elements. Note that the stream itself is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
        a resource that should be closed down on EOS! Applications might seek
        back to a point before EOS and continue playing again.
      </p><p>
        The EOS event has no properties, which makes it one of the simplest
        events in <span class="application">GStreamer</span>. It is created using the 
        <code class="function">gst_event_new_eos()</code> function.
      </p><p>
        It is important to note that <span class="emphasis"><em>only elements driving the
        pipeline should ever send an EOS event</em></span>. If your element
        is chain-based, it is not driving the pipeline. Chain-based elements
        should just return GST_FLOW_EOS from their chain function at
        the end of the stream (or the configured segment), the upstream
        element that is driving the pipeline will then take care of
        sending the EOS event (or alternatively post a SEGMENT_DONE message
        on the bus depending on the mode of operation). If you are implementing
        your own source element, you also do not need to ever manually send
        an EOS event, you should also just return GST_FLOW_EOS in
        your create or fill function (assuming your element derives from
        GstBaseSrc or GstPushSrc).
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-events-toc"></a>Table Of Contents</h3></div></div></div><p>
        WRITEME
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-events-gap"></a>Gap</h3></div></div></div><p>
        WRITEME
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-events-flush-start"></a>Flush Start</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The flush start event is sent downstream (in push mode) or upstream
        (in pull mode) if all buffers and caches in the pipeline should be
        emptied. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Queue</span>”</span> elements will
        empty their internal list of buffers when they receive this event, for
        example. File sink elements (e.g. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">filesink</span>”</span>) will flush
        the kernel-to-disk cache (<code class="function">fdatasync ()</code> or
        <code class="function">fflush ()</code>) when they receive this event. Normally,
        elements receiving this event will simply just forward it, since most
        filter or filter-like elements don't have an internal cache of data.
        <code class="function">gst_pad_event_default ()</code> does just that, so for
        most elements, it is enough to forward the event using the default
        event handler.
      </p><p>
        As a side-effect of flushing all data from the pipeline, this event
        unblocks the streaming thread by making all pads reject data until
        they receive a <a class="xref" href="section-events-definitions.html#section-events-flush-stop" title="Flush Stop">Flush Stop</a> signal
        (elements trying to push data will get a FLUSHING flow return
         and stop processing data).
      </p><p>
        The flush-start event is created with the
        <code class="function">gst_event_new_flush_start ()</code>.
        Like the EOS event, it has no properties. This event is usually
        only created by elements driving the pipeline, like source elements
        operating in push-mode or pull-range based demuxers/decoders.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-events-flush-stop"></a>Flush Stop</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The flush-stop event is sent by an element driving the pipeline
        after a flush-start and tells pads and elements downstream that
        they should accept events and buffers again (there will be at
        least a SEGMENT event before any buffers first though).
      </p><p>
        If your element keeps temporary caches of stream data, it should
        clear them when it receives a FLUSH-STOP event (and also whenever
        its chain function receives a buffer with the DISCONT flag set).
      </p><p>
        The flush-stop event is created with
        <code class="function">gst_event_new_flush_stop ()</code>. It has one
        parameter that controls if the running-time of the pipeline should
        be reset to 0 or not. Normally aftera flushing seek, the
        running_time is set back to 0.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-events-qos"></a>Quality Of Service (QOS)</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The QOS event contains a report about the current real-time
        performance of the stream. See more info in 
        <a class="xref" href="chapter-advanced-qos.html" title="Chapter 19. Quality Of Service (QoS)">Chapter 19, <i>Quality Of Service (QoS)</i></a>.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-events-seek"></a>Seek Request</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Seek events are meant to request a new stream position to elements.
        This new position can be set in several formats (time, bytes or
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">default units</span>”</span> [a term indicating frames for video,
        channel-independent samples for audio, etc.]). Seeking can be done with
        respect to the end-of-file or start-of-file, and
        usually happens in upstream direction (downstream seeking is done by
        sending a SEGMENT event with the appropriate offsets for elements
        that support that, like filesink).
      </p><p>
        Elements receiving seek events should, depending on the element type,
        either just forward it upstream (filters, decoders), change the
        format in which the event is given and then forward it (demuxers),
        or handle the event by changing the file pointer in their internal
        stream resource (file sources, demuxers/decoders driving the pipeline
        in pull-mode) or something else.
      </p><p>
        Seek events are built up using positions in specified formats (time,
        bytes, units). They are created using the function
        <code class="function">gst_event_new_seek ()</code>. Note that many plugins do
        not support seeking from the end of the stream.
        An element not driving the pipeline and forwarding a seek
        request should not assume that the seek succeeded or actually happened,
        it should operate based on the SEGMENT events it receives.
      </p><p>
        Elements parsing this event can do this using
        <code class="function">gst_event_parse_seek()</code>.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-events-nav"></a>Navigation</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Navigation events are sent upstream by video sinks to inform upstream
        elements of where the mouse pointer is, if and where mouse pointer
        clicks have happened, or if keys have been pressed or released.
      </p><p>
        All this information is contained in the event structure which can
        be obtained with <code class="function">gst_event_get_structure ()</code>.
      </p><p>

        how to extract navigation information from this event.
