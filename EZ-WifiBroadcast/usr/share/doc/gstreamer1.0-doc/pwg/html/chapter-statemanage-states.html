    A state describes whether the element instance is initialized, whether it
    is ready to transfer data and whether it is currently handling data. There
    are four states defined in <span class="application">GStreamer</span>:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="symbol">GST_STATE_NULL</span>

        <span class="symbol">GST_STATE_READY</span>

    which will from now on be referred to simply as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">NULL</span>”</span>,
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">READY</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">PAUSED</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">PLAYING</span>”</span>.
  </p><p>
    <span class="symbol">GST_STATE_NULL</span> is the default state of an element. In this state, it
    has not allocated any runtime resources, it has not loaded any runtime
    libraries and it can obviously not handle data.
  </p><p>
    <span class="symbol">GST_STATE_READY</span> is the next state that an element can be in. In the
    READY state, an element has all default resources (runtime-libraries,
    runtime-memory) allocated. However, it has not yet allocated or defined
    anything that is stream-specific. When going from NULL to READY state
    (<span class="symbol">GST_STATE_CHANGE_NULL_TO_READY</span>), an element should
    allocate any non-stream-specific resources and should load runtime-loadable
    libraries (if any). When going the other way around (from READY to NULL,
    <span class="symbol">GST_STATE_CHANGE_READY_TO_NULL</span>), an element should unload
    these libraries and free all allocated resources. Examples of such
    resources are hardware devices. Note that files are generally streams,
    and these should thus be considered as stream-specific resources; therefore,
    they should <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be allocated in this state.
  </p><p>
    <span class="symbol">GST_STATE_PAUSED</span> is the state in which an element is 
    ready to accept and handle data. For most elements this state is the same
    as PLAYING. The only exception to this rule are sink elements. Sink
    elements only accept one single buffer of data and then block. At this
    point the pipeline is 'prerolled' and ready to render data immediately.
  </p><p>
    <span class="symbol">GST_STATE_PLAYING</span> is the highest state that an element
    can be in. For most elements this state is exactly the same as PAUSED,
    they accept and process events and buffers with data. Only sink elements
    need to differentiate between PAUSED and PLAYING state. In PLAYING state,
    sink elements actually render incoming data, e.g. output audio to a sound
    card or render video pictures to an image sink.
  </p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section-statemanage-filters"></a>Managing filter state</h2></div></div></div><p>
    If at all possible, your element should derive from one of the new base 
    classes (<a class="xref" href="chapter-other-base.html" title="Chapter 23. Pre-made base classes">Pre-made base classes</a>). There are ready-made 
    general purpose base classes for different types of sources, sinks and
    filter/transformation elements. In addition to those, specialised base 
    classes exist for audio and video elements and others.
  </p><p>
    If you use a base class, you will rarely have to handle state changes 
    yourself. All you have to do is override the base class's start() and
    stop() virtual functions (might be called differently depending on the
    base class) and the base class will take care of everything for you.
  </p><p>
    If, however, you do not derive from a ready-made base class, but from 
    GstElement or some other class not built on top of a base class, you 
    will most likely have to implement your own state change function to
    be notified of state changes. This is definitively necessary if your
    plugin is a demuxer or a muxer, as there are no base classes for
    muxers or demuxers yet.
  </p><p>
    An element can be notified of state changes through a virtual function
    pointer. Inside this function, the element can initialize any sort of
    specific data needed by the element, and it can optionally fail to
    go from one state to another.
  </p><p>
    Do not g_assert for unhandled state changes; this is taken care of by
    the GstElement base class.

    Note that upwards (NULL=&gt;READY, READY=&gt;PAUSED, PAUSED=&gt;PLAYING)
    and downwards (PLAYING=&gt;PAUSED, PAUSED=&gt;READY, READY=&gt;NULL) state
    changes are handled in two separate blocks with the downwards state change
    handled only after we have chained up to the parent class's state
    change function. This is necessary in order to safely handle concurrent
    access by multiple threads.
  </p><p>
    The reason for this is that in the case of downwards state changes
    you don't want to destroy allocated resources while your plugin's 
    chain function (for example) is still accessing those resources in
    another thread. Whether your chain function might be running or not
    depends on the state of your plugin's pads, and the state of those
    pads is closely linked to the state of the element. Pad states are
    handled in the GstElement class's state change function, including
    proper locking, that's why it is essential to chain up before
    destroying allocated resources.
