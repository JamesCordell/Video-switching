      All streams of data in <span class="application">GStreamer</span> are chopped up into chunks that are
      passed from a source pad on one element to a sink pad on another element.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>GstMiniObject</em></span> is the structure used to hold these
      chunks of data.
    </p><p>
      GstMiniObject contains the following important types:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            An exact type indicating what type of data (event, buffer, ...)
            this GstMiniObject is.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            A reference count indicating the number of elements currently
            holding a reference to the miniobject. When the reference count
            falls to zero, the miniobject will be disposed, and its memory will be
            freed in some sense (see below for more details).
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
      For data transport, there are two types of GstMiniObject defined:
      events (control) and buffers (content).
    </p><p>
      Buffers may contain any sort of data that the two linked pads
      know how to handle. Normally, a buffer contains a chunk of some sort of
      audio or video data that flows from one element to another.
    </p><p>
      Buffers also contain metadata describing the buffer's contents. Some of
      the important types of metadata are:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            Pointers to one or more GstMemory objects. GstMemory objects are
            refcounted objects that encapsulate a region of memory.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            A timestamp indicating the preferred display timestamp of the
            content in the buffer.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
      Events
      contain information on the state of the stream flowing between the two
      linked pads. Events will only be sent if the element explicitly supports
      them, else the core will (try to) handle the events automatically. Events
      are used to indicate, for example, a media type, the end of a
      media stream or that the cache should be flushed.
    </p><p>
      Events may contain several of the following items:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            A subtype indicating the type of the contained event.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The other contents of the event depend on the specific event type.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
      Events will be discussed extensively in <a class="xref" href="chapter-advanced-events.html" title="Chapter 17. Events: Seeking, Navigation and More">Chapter 17, <i>Events: Seeking, Navigation and More</i></a>.
      Until then, the only event that will be used is the <span class="emphasis"><em>EOS</em></span>
      event, which is used to indicate the end-of-stream (usually end-of-file).
    </p><p>

        Buffers are able to store chunks of memory of several different
	types.  The most generic type of buffer contains memory allocated
	by malloc().  Such buffers, although convenient, are not always
	very fast, since data often needs to be specifically copied into
	the buffer.
      </p><p>
	Many specialized elements create buffers that point to special
	memory.  For example, the filesrc element usually
	maps a file into the address space of the application (using mmap()),
	and creates buffers that point into that address range.  These
	buffers created by filesrc act exactly like generic buffers, except
	that they are read-only.  The buffer freeing code automatically
	determines the correct method of freeing the underlying memory.
	Downstream elements that receive these kinds of buffers do not
	need to do anything special to handle or unreference it.
      </p><p>
        Another way an element might get specialized buffers is to
        request them from a downstream peer through a GstBufferPool or
        GstAllocator.  Elements can ask a GstBufferPool or GstAllocator
        from the downstream peer element. If downstream is able to provide
        these objects, upstream can use them to allocate buffers.
        See more in <a class="xref" href="chapter-allocation.html" title="Chapter 15. Memory allocation">Memory allocation</a>.
      </p><p>
        Many sink elements have accelerated methods for copying data
	to hardware, or have direct access to hardware.  It is common
        for these elements to be able to create a GstBufferPool or 
        GstAllocator for their upstream peers.  One such example is
	ximagesink.  It creates buffers that contain XImages.  Thus,
	when an upstream peer copies data into the buffer, it is copying
	directly into the XImage, enabling ximagesink to draw the
	image directly to the screen instead of having to copy data
	into an XImage first.
      </p><p>
        Filter elements often have the opportunity to either work on
	a buffer in-place, or work while copying from a source buffer
	to a destination buffer.  It is optimal to implement both
	algorithms, since the <span class="application">GStreamer</span> framework can choose the
	fastest algorithm as appropriate.  Naturally, this only makes
	sense for strict filters -- elements that have exactly the
	same format on source and sink pads.
