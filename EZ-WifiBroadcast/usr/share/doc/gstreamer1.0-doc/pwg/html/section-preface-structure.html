      To help you navigate through this guide, it is divided into several large
      parts. Each part addresses a particular broad topic concerning <span class="application">GStreamer</span>
      plugin development. The parts of this guide are laid out in the following
      order:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          <a class="xref" href="part-building.html" title="Part II. Building a Plugin">Building a Plugin</a> -
          Introduction to the structure of a plugin, using an example audio
          filter for illustration.
        </p><p>
          This part covers all the basic steps you generally need to perform
          to build a plugin, such as registering the element with <span class="application">GStreamer</span>
          and setting up the basics so it can receive data from and send data
          to neighbour elements. The discussion begins by giving examples of
          generating the basic structures and registering an element in
          <a class="xref" href="chapter-building-boiler.html" title="Chapter 3. Constructing the Boilerplate">Constructing the Boilerplate</a>. Then, you will learn how
          to write the code to get a basic filter plugin working in <a class="xref" href="chapter-building-pads.html" title="Chapter 4. Specifying the pads">Chapter 4, <i>Specifying the pads</i></a>, <a class="xref" href="chapter-building-chainfn.html" title="Chapter 5. The chain function">Chapter 5, <i>The chain function</i></a> and <a class="xref" href="chapter-statemanage-states.html" title="Chapter 8. What are states?">Chapter 8, <i>What are states?</i></a>.
        </p><p>
          After that, we will show some of the GObject concepts on how to
          make an element configurable for applications and how to do
          application-element interaction in
          <a class="xref" href="chapter-building-args.html" title="Chapter 9. Adding Properties">Adding Properties</a> and <a class="xref" href="chapter-building-signals.html" title="Chapter 10. Signals">Chapter 10, <i>Signals</i></a>. Next, you will learn to build
          a quick test application to test all that you've just learned in
          <a class="xref" href="chapter-building-testapp.html" title="Chapter 11. Building a Test Application">Chapter 11, <i>Building a Test Application</i></a>. We will just touch upon
          basics here. For full-blown application development, you should
          look at <a class="ulink" href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/manual/html/index.html" target="_top">the
          Application Development Manual</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          <a class="xref" href="part-advanced.html" title="Part III. Advanced Filter Concepts">Advanced Filter Concepts</a> -
          Information on advanced features of <span class="application">GStreamer</span> plugin development.
        </p><p>
          After learning about the basic steps, you should be able to create a
          functional audio or video filter plugin with some nice features.
          However, <span class="application">GStreamer</span> offers more for plugin writers. This part of the
          guide includes chapters on more advanced topics, such as scheduling,
          media type definitions in <span class="application">GStreamer</span>, clocks, interfaces and
          tagging. Since these features are purpose-specific, you can read them
          in any order, most of them don't require knowledge from other
          sections.
        </p><p>
          The first chapter, named <a class="xref" href="chapter-scheduling.html" title="Chapter 13. Different scheduling modes">Different scheduling modes</a>,
          will explain some of the basics of element scheduling. It is not
          very in-depth, but is mostly some sort of an introduction on why
          other things work as they do. Read this chapter if you're interested
          in <span class="application">GStreamer</span> internals. Next, we will apply this knowledge and
          discuss another type of data transmission than what you learned in
          <a class="xref" href="chapter-building-chainfn.html" title="Chapter 5. The chain function">Chapter 5, <i>The chain function</i></a>: <a class="xref" href="chapter-scheduling.html" title="Chapter 13. Different scheduling modes">Different scheduling modes</a>. Loop-based elements will give
          you more control over input rate. This is useful when writing, for
          example, muxers or demuxers.
        </p><p>
          Next, we will discuss media identification in <span class="application">GStreamer</span> in <a class="xref" href="chapter-building-types.html" title="Chapter 16. Types and Properties">Chapter 16, <i>Types and Properties</i></a>. You will learn how to define
          new media types and get to know a list of standard media types
          defined in <span class="application">GStreamer</span>.
        </p><p>
          In the next chapter, you will learn the concept of request- and
          sometimes-pads, which are pads that are created dynamically, either
          because the application asked for it (request) or because the media
          stream requires it (sometimes). This will be in <a class="xref" href="chapter-advanced-request.html" title="Chapter 12. Request and Sometimes pads">Chapter 12, <i>Request and Sometimes pads</i></a>.
        </p><p>
          The next chapter, <a class="xref" href="chapter-advanced-clock.html" title="Chapter 18. Clocking">Chapter 18, <i>Clocking</i></a>, will
          explain the concept of clocks in <span class="application">GStreamer</span>. You need this
          information when you want to know how elements should achieve
          audio/video synchronization.
        </p><p>
          The next few chapters will discuss advanced ways of doing
          application-element interaction. Previously, we learned on the
          GObject-ways of doing this in <a class="xref" href="chapter-building-args.html" title="Chapter 9. Adding Properties">Adding Properties</a>
          and <a class="xref" href="chapter-building-signals.html" title="Chapter 10. Signals">Chapter 10, <i>Signals</i></a>. We will discuss
          dynamic parameters, which are a way of defining element behaviour
          over time in advance, in <a class="xref" href="chapter-dparams.html" title="Chapter 20. Supporting Dynamic Parameters">Chapter 20, <i>Supporting Dynamic Parameters</i></a>. Next,
          you will learn about interfaces in <a class="xref" href="chapter-advanced-interfaces.html" title="Chapter 21. Interfaces">Chapter 21, <i>Interfaces</i></a>. Interfaces are very target-
          specific ways of application-element interaction, based on GObject's
          GInterface. Lastly, you will learn about how metadata is handled in
          <span class="application">GStreamer</span> in <a class="xref" href="chapter-advanced-tagging.html" title="Chapter 22. Tagging (Metadata and Streaminfo)">Chapter 22, <i>Tagging (Metadata and Streaminfo)</i></a>.
        </p><p>
          The last chapter, <a class="xref" href="chapter-advanced-events.html" title="Chapter 17. Events: Seeking, Navigation and More">Chapter 17, <i>Events: Seeking, Navigation and More</i></a>, will
          discuss the concept of events in <span class="application">GStreamer</span>. Events are, on the
          one hand, another way of doing application-element interaction. It
          takes care of seeking, for example. On the other hand, it is also
          a way in which elements interact with each other, such as letting
          each other know about media stream discontinuities, forwarding tags
          inside a pipeline and so on.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          <a class="xref" href="part-other.html" title="Part IV. Creating special element types">Creating special element types</a> - Explanation
          of writing other plugin types.
        </p><p>
          Because the first two parts of the guide use an audio filter as an
          example, the concepts introduced apply to filter plugins. But many of
          the concepts apply equally to other plugin types, including sources,
          sinks, and autopluggers. This part of the guide presents the issues
          that arise when working on these more specialized plugin types. The
          chapter starts with a special focus on elements that can be written
          using a base-class (<a class="xref" href="chapter-other-base.html" title="Chapter 23. Pre-made base classes">Pre-made base classes</a>), and
          later also goes into writing special types of elements in
          <a class="xref" href="chapter-other-oneton.html" title="Chapter 24. Writing a Demuxer or Parser">Writing a Demuxer or Parser</a>, <a class="xref" href="chapter-other-ntoone.html" title="Chapter 25. Writing a N-to-1 Element or Muxer">Writing a N-to-1 Element or Muxer</a> and <a class="xref" href="chapter-other-manager.html" title="Chapter 26. Writing a Manager">Writing a Manager</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          <a class="xref" href="part-appendix.html" title="Part V. Appendices">Appendices</a> - Further
          information for plugin developers.
        </p><p>
          The appendices contain some information that stubbornly refuses
          to fit cleanly in other sections of the guide. Most of this section
          is not yet finished.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      The remainder of this introductory part of the guide presents a short
      overview of the basic concepts involved in <span class="application">GStreamer</span> plugin development.
      Topics covered include <a class="xref" href="chapter-intro-basics.html#section-basics-elements" title="Elements and Plugins">Elements and Plugins</a>, <a class="xref" href="section-basics-pads.html" title="Pads">Pads</a>, <a class="xref" href="section-basics-data.html" title="GstMiniObject, Buffers and Events">Data, Buffers and Events</a> and
