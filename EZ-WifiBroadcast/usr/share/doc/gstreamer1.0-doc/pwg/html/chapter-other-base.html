    So far, we've been looking at low-level concepts of creating any type of
    <span class="application">GStreamer</span> element. Now, let's assume that all you want is to create an
    simple audiosink that works exactly the same as, say,
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">esdsink</span>”</span>, or a filter that simply normalizes audio volume.
    Such elements are very general in concept and since they do nothing
    special, they should be easier to code than to provide your own scheduler
    activation functions and doing complex caps negotiation. For this purpose,
    <span class="application">GStreamer</span> provides base classes that simplify some types of elements.
    Those base classes will be discussed in this chapter.
  </p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section-base-sink"></a>Writing a sink</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Sinks are special elements in <span class="application">GStreamer</span>. This is because sink elements
      have to take care of <span class="emphasis"><em>preroll</em></span>, which is the process
      that takes care that elements going into the
      <code class="classname">GST_STATE_PAUSED</code> state will have buffers ready
      after the state change. The result of this is that such elements can
      start processing data immediately after going into the
      <code class="classname">GST_STATE_PLAYING</code> state, without requiring to
      take some time to initialize outputs or set up decoders; all that is done
      already before the state-change to <code class="classname">GST_STATE_PAUSED</code>
      successfully completes.
    </p><p>
      Preroll, however, is a complex process that would require the same
      code in many elements. Therefore, sink elements can derive from the
      <code class="classname">GstBaseSink</code> base-class, which does preroll and
      a few other utility functions automatically. The derived class only
      needs to implement a bunch of virtual functions and will work
      automatically.
    </p><p>
      The base class implement much of the synchronization logic that a
      sink has to perform.
    </p><p>
      The <code class="classname">GstBaseSink</code> base-class specifies some
      limitations on elements, though:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          It requires that the sink only has one sinkpad. Sink elements that
          need more than one sinkpad, must make a manager element with
          multiple GstBaseSink elements inside.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Sink elements can derive from <code class="classname">GstBaseSink</code> using
      the usual <code class="classname">GObject</code> convenience macro
      <code class="function">G_DEFINE_TYPE ()</code>:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
G_DEFINE_TYPE (GstMySink, gst_my_sink, GST_TYPE_BASE_SINK);

[..]

static void
gst_my_sink_class_init (GstMySinkClass * klass)
{
  klass-&gt;set_caps = [..];
  klass-&gt;render = [..];
[..]
}
    </pre><p>
      The advantages of deriving from <code class="classname">GstBaseSink</code> are
      numerous:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          Derived implementations barely need to be aware of preroll, and do
          not need to know anything about the technical implementation
          requirements of preroll. The base-class does all the hard work.
        </p><p>
          Less code to write in the derived class, shared code (and thus
          shared bugfixes).
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      There are also specialized base classes for audio and video, let's look
      at those a bit.
    </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-base-audiosink"></a>Writing an audio sink</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Essentially, audio sink implementations are just a special case of a
        general sink. An audio sink has the added complexity that it needs to
        schedule playback of samples. It must match the clock selected in the
        pipeline against the clock of the audio device and calculate and
        compensate for drift and jitter.
      </p><p>
        There are two audio base classes that you can choose to
        derive from, depending on your needs:
        <code class="classname">GstAudioBasesink</code> and
        <code class="classname">GstAudioSink</code>. The audiobasesink provides full
        control over how synchronization and scheduling is handled, by using
        a ringbuffer that the derived class controls and provides. The
        audiosink base-class is a derived class of the audiobasesink,
        implementing a standard ringbuffer implementing default
        synchronization and providing a standard audio-sample clock. Derived
        classes of this base class merely need to provide a <code class="function">_open
        ()</code>, <code class="function">_close ()</code> and a <code class="function">_write
        ()</code> function implementation, and some optional functions.
        This should suffice for many sound-server output elements and even
        most interfaces. More demanding audio systems, such as Jack, would
        want to implement the <code class="classname">GstAudioBaseSink</code>
        base-class.
      </p><p>
        The <code class="classname">GstBaseAusioSink</code> has little to no
        limitations and should fit virtually every implementation, but is
        hard to implement. The <code class="classname">GstAudioSink</code>, on the
        other hand, only fits those systems with a simple <code class="function">open
        ()</code> / <code class="function">close ()</code> / <code class="function">write
        ()</code> API (which practically means pretty much all of them),
        but has the advantage that it is a lot easier to implement. The
        benefits of this second base class are large:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            Automatic synchronization, without any code in the derived class.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Also automatically provides a clock, so that other sinks (e.g. in
            case of audio/video playback) are synchronized.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Features can be added to all audiosinks by making a change in the
            base class, which makes maintenance easy.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Derived classes require only three small functions, plus some
            <code class="classname">GObject</code> boilerplate code.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        In addition to implementing the audio base-class virtual functions,
        derived classes can (should) also implement the
        <code class="classname">GstBaseSink</code> <code class="function">set_caps ()</code> and
        <code class="function">get_caps ()</code> virtual functions for negotiation.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-base-videosink"></a>Writing a video sink</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Writing a videosink can be done using the
        <code class="classname">GstVideoSink</code> base-class, which derives from
        <code class="classname">GstBaseSink</code> internally. Currently, it does
        nothing yet but add another compile dependency, so derived classes
        will need to implement all base-sink virtual functions. When they do
        this correctly, this will have some positive effects on the end user
        experience with the videosink:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            Because of preroll (and the <code class="function">preroll ()</code> virtual
            function), it is possible to display a video frame already when
            going into the <code class="classname">GST_STATE_PAUSED</code> state.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            By adding new features to <code class="classname">GstVideoSink</code>, it
            will be possible to add extensions to videosinks that affect all of
            them, but only need to be coded once, which is a huge maintenance
            benefit.
