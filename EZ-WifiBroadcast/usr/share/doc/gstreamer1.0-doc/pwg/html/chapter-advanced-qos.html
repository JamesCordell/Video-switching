    Quality of Service in <span class="application">GStreamer</span> is about measuring and ajusting
    the real-time performance of a pipeline. The real-time performance is
    always measured relative to the pipeline clock and typically happens in
    the sinks when they synchronize buffers against the clock.
  </p><p>
    When buffers arrive late in the sink, i.e. when their running-time is
    smaller than that of the clock, we say that the pipeline is having a
    quality of service problem. These are a few possible reasons:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        High CPU load, there is not enough CPU power to handle the stream,
        causing buffers to arrive late in the sink.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Network problems
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Other resource problems such as disk load, memory bottlenecks etc
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
    The measurements result in QOS events that aim to adjust the datarate
    in one or more upstream elements. Two types of adjustments can be
    made:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        Short time "emergency" corrections based on latest observation in
        the sinks.
      </p><p>
        Long term rate corrections based on trends observed in the sinks.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
    It is also possible for the application to artificially introduce delay
    between synchronized buffers, this is called throttling. It can be used
    to limit or reduce the framerate, for example.
  </p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section-measuring"></a>Measuring QoS</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Elements that synchronize buffers on the pipeline clock will usually
      measure the current QoS. They will also need to keep some statistics
      in order to generate the QOS event.
    </p><p>
      For each buffer that arrives in the sink, the element needs to calculate
      how late or how early it was. This is called the jitter. Negative jitter
      values mean that the buffer was early, positive values mean that the
      buffer was late. the jitter value gives an indication of how early/late
      a buffer was.
    </p><p>
      A synchronizing element will also need to calculate how much time
      elapsed between receiving two consecutive buffers. We call this the
      processing time because that is the amount of time it takes for the
      upstream element to produce/process the buffer. We can compare this
      processing time to the duration of the buffer to have a measurement
      of how fast upstream can produce data, called the proportion.
      If, for example, upstream can produce a buffer in 0.5 seconds of 1
      second long, it is operating at twice the required speed. If, on the
      other hand, it takes 2 seconds to produce a buffer with 1 seconds worth
      of data, upstream is producing buffers too slow and we won't be able to
      keep sycnhronization. Usually, a running average is kept of the
      proportion.
    </p><p>
      A synchronizing element also needs to measure its own performance in
      order to figure out if the performace problem is upstream of itself.
    </p><p>
      These measurements are used to construct a QOS event that is sent
      upstream. Note that a QoS event is sent for each buffer that arrives
      in the sink.
