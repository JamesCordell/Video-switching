    When playing complex media, each sound and video sample must be played in a
    specific order at a specific time. For this purpose, GStreamer provides a
    synchronization mechanism.
  </p><p>
    <span class="application">GStreamer</span> provides support for the following use cases:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          Non-live sources with access faster than playback rate. This is
          the case where one is reading media from a file and playing it
          back in a synchronized fashion. In this case, multiple streams need
          to be synchronized, like audio, video and subtitles.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Capture and synchronized muxing/mixing of media from multiple live
          sources. This is a typical use case where you record audio and
          video from a microphone/camera and mux it into a file for 
          storage.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Streaming from (slow) network streams with buffering. This is the
          typical web streaming case where you access content from a streaming
          server with http.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Capture from live source and and playback to live source with
          configurable latency. This is used when, for example, capture from
          a camera, apply an effect and display the result. It is also used
          when streaming low latency content over a network with UDP.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Simultaneous live capture and playback from prerecorded content.
          This is used in audio recording cases where you play a previously
          recorded audio and record new samples, the purpose is to have the
          new audio perfectly in sync with the previously recorded data.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>

    <span class="application">GStreamer</span> uses a <code class="classname">GstClock</code> object, buffer
    timestamps and a SEGMENT event to synchronize streams in a pipeline
    as we will see in the next sections.
  </p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section-clock-time-types"></a>Clock running-time </h2></div></div></div><p>
      In a typical computer, there are many sources that can be used as a
      time source, e.g., the system time, soundcards, CPU performance
      counters, ... For this reason, there are many
      <code class="classname">GstClock</code> implementations available in <span class="application">GStreamer</span>.
      The clock time doesn't always start from 0 or from some known value.
      Some clocks start counting from some known start date, other clocks start
      counting since last reboot, etc...
    </p><p>
      A <code class="classname">GstClock</code> returns the
      <span class="strong"><strong>absolute-time</strong></span>
      according to that clock with <code class="function">gst_clock_get_time ()</code>.
      The absolute-time (or clock time) of a clock is monotonically increasing.
      From the absolute-time is a <span class="strong"><strong>running-time</strong></span>
      calculated, which is simply the difference between a previous snapshot
      of the absolute-time called the <span class="strong"><strong>base-time</strong></span>.
      So:
    </p><p>
      running-time = absolute-time - base-time
    </p><p>
      A <span class="application">GStreamer</span> <code class="classname">GstPipeline</code> object maintains a
      <code class="classname">GstClock</code> object and a base-time when it goes
      to the PLAYING state.  The pipeline gives a handle to the selected
      <code class="classname">GstClock</code> to each element in the pipeline along
      with selected base-time. The pipeline will select a base-time in such
      a way that the running-time reflects the total time spent in the
      PLAYING state. As a result, when the pipeline is PAUSED, the
      running-time stands still.
    </p><p>
      Because all objects in the pipeline have the same clock and base-time,
      they can thus all calculate the running-time according to the pipeline
      clock.
