  Porting to 1.0</a> document.

    It should be possible to port simple applications to
    <span class="application">GStreamer</span>-1.0 in less than a day.

          All deprecated methods were removed. Recompile against 0.10 with
	  GST_DISABLE_DEPRECATED defined (such as by adding
	  -DGST_DISABLE_DEPRECATED to the compiler flags) and fix issues
	  before attempting to port to 1.0.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          "playbin2" has been renamed to "playbin", with similar API
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          "decodebin2" has been renamed to "decodebin", with similar API. Note
          that there is no longer a "new-decoded-pad" signal, just use GstElement's
          "pad-added" signal instead (but don't forget to remove the 'gboolean last'
          argument from your old signal callback functino signature).
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          the names of some "formatted" pad templates has been changed from e.g.
          "src%d" to "src%u" or "src_%u" or similar, since we don't want to see
          negative numbers in pad names. This mostly affects applications that
          create request pads from elements.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          some elements that used to have a single dynamic source pad have a
          source pad now. Example: wavparse, id3demux, iceydemux, apedemux.
          (This does not affect applications using decodebin or playbin).
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          playbin now proxies the GstVideoOverlay (former GstXOverlay) interface,
          so most applications can just remove the sync bus handler where they
          would set the window ID, and instead just set the window ID on playbin
          from the application thread before starting playback.
        </p><p>
          playbin also proxies the GstColorBalance and GstNavigation interfaces,
          so applications that use this don't need to go fishing for elements
	  that may implement those any more, but can just use on playbin
	  unconditionally.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          multifdsink, tcpclientsink, tcpclientsrc, tcpserversrc the protocol property
          is removed, use gdppay and gdpdepay.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          XML serialization was removed.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Probes and pad blocking was merged into new pad probes.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Position, duration and convert functions no longer use an inout parameter
          for the destination format.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Video and audio caps were simplified. audio/x-raw-int and audio/x-raw-float
          are now all under the audio/x-raw media type. Similarly, video/x-raw-rgb
          and video/x-raw-yuv are now video/x-raw.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          ffmpegcolorspace was removed and replaced with videoconvert.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          GstMixerInterface / GstTunerInterface were removed without replacement.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The GstXOverlay interface was renamed to GstVideoOverlay, and now part
          of the video library in gst-plugins-base, as the interfaces library
          no longer exists.
        </p><p>
          The name of the GstXOverlay "prepare-xwindow-id" message has changed
          to "prepare-window-handle" (and GstXOverlay has been renamed to
          GstVideoOverlay). Code that checks for the string directly should be
          changed to use gst_is_video_overlay_prepare_window_handle_message(message)
          instead.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The GstPropertyProbe interface was removed. the is no replacement yet,
          but a more featureful replacement for device discovery and feature
          querying is planned, see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678402
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          gst_uri_handler_get_uri() and the get_uri vfunc now return a copy of
          the URI string
        </p><p>
          gst_uri_handler_set_uri() and the set_uri vfunc now take an additional
          GError argument so the handler can notify the caller why it didn't
          accept a particular URI.
        </p><p>
          gst_uri_handler_set_uri() now checks if the protocol of the URI passed
          is one of the protocols advertised by the uri handler, so set_uri vfunc
          implementations no longer need to check that as well.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          GstTagList is now an opaque mini object instead of being typedefed to a
          GstStructure. While it was previously okay (and in some cases required because of
          missing taglist API) to cast a GstTagList to a GstStructure or use
          gst_structure_* API on taglists, you can no longer do that. Doing so will
          cause crashes.
        </p><p>
          Also, tag lists are refcounted now, and can therefore not be freely
          modified any longer. Make sure to call gst_tag_list_make_writable (taglist)
          before adding, removing or changing tags in the taglist.
        </p><p>
          GST_TAG_IMAGE, GST_TAG_PREVIEW_IMAGE, GST_TAG_ATTACHMENT: many tags that
          used to be of type GstBuffer are now of type GstSample (which is basically
          a struct containing a buffer alongside caps and some other info).
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          GstController has now been merged into GstObject. It does not exists as an
          individual object anymore. In addition core contains a GstControlSource base
          class and the GstControlBinding. The actual control sources are in the controller
          library as before. The 2nd big change is that control sources generate
          a sequence of gdouble values and those are mapped to the property type and
          value range by GstControlBindings.
        </p><p>
          The whole gst_controller_* API is gone and now available in simplified form
          under gst_object_*. ControlSources are now attached via GstControlBinding
          to properties. There are no GValue arguments used anymore when programming
          control sources.
