      A clock provider is an element in the pipeline that can provide
      a <code class="classname">GstClock</code> object. The clock object needs to
      report an absoulute-time that is monotonocally increasing when the
      element is in the PLAYING state. It is allowed to pause the clock
      while the element is PAUSED.
    </p><p>
      Clock providers exist because they play back media at some rate, and
      this rate is not necessarily the same as the system clock rate. For
      example, a soundcard may playback at 44,1 kHz, but that doesn't mean
      that after <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> 1 second <span class="emphasis"><em>according
      to the system clock</em></span>, the soundcard has played back 44.100
      samples. This is only true by approximation. In fact, the audio
      device has an internal clock based on the number of samples played
      that we can expose.
    </p><p>
      If an element with an internal clock needs to synchronize, it needs
      to estimate when a time according to the pipeline clock will take
      place according to the internal clock. To estimate this, it needs
      to slave its clock to the pipeline clock.
    </p><p>
      If the pipeline clock is exactly the internal clock of an element,
      the element can skip the slaving step and directly use the pipeline
      clock to schedule playback. This can be both faster and more
      accurate.
      Therefore, generally, elements with an internal clock like audio
      input or output devices will be a clock provider for the pipeline.
    </p><p>
      When the pipeline goes to the PLAYING state, it will go over all
      elements in the pipeline from sink to source and ask each element
      if they can provide a clock. The last element that can provide a
      clock will be used as the clock provider in the pipeline.
      This algorithm prefers a clock from an audio sink in a typical
      playback pipeline and a clock from source elements in a typical
      capture pipeline.
    </p><p>
      There exist some bus messages to let you know about the clock and
      clock providers in the pipeline. You can see what clock is selected
      in the pipeline by looking at the NEW_CLOCK message on the bus.
      When a clock provider is removed from the pipeline, a CLOCK_LOST
      message is posted and the application should go to PAUSED and back
      to PLAYING to select a new clock.
