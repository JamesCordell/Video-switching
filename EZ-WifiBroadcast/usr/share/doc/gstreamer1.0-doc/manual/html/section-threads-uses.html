      We have seen that threads are created by elements but it is also
      possible to insert elements in the pipeline for the sole purpose of
      forcing a new thread in the pipeline.
    </p><p>
      There are several reasons to force the use of threads. However,
      for performance reasons, you never want to use one thread for every
      element out there, since that will create some overhead.
      Let's now list some situations where threads can be particularly
      useful:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          Data buffering, for example when dealing with network streams or
          when recording data from a live stream such as a video or audio
          card. Short hickups elsewhere in the pipeline will not cause data
          loss. See also <a class="xref" href="chapter-buffering.html#section-buffering-stream" title="Stream buffering">the section called “Stream buffering ”</a> about network
          buffering with queue2.

          Synchronizing output devices, e.g. when playing a stream containing
          both video and audio data. By using threads for both outputs, they
          will run independently and their synchronization will be better.
        </p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a name="section-thread-synchronizing-img"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 17.2. Synchronizing audio and video sinks</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/thread-synchronizing.png" width="405" alt="Synchronizing audio and video sinks"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"></div></li></ul></div><p>
      Above, we've mentioned the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">queue</span>”</span> element several times
      now. A queue is the thread boundary element through which you can
      force the use of threads. It does so by using a classic
      provider/consumer model as learned in threading classes at
      universities all around the world. By doing this, it acts both as a
      means to make data throughput between threads threadsafe, and it can
      also act as a buffer. Queues have several <code class="classname">GObject</code>
      properties to be configured for specific uses. For example, you can set
      lower and upper thresholds for the element. If there's less data than
      the lower threshold (default: disabled), it will block output. If
      there's more data than the upper threshold, it will block input or
      (if configured to do so) drop data.
    </p><p>
      To use a queue (and therefore force the use of two distinct threads
      in the pipeline), one can simply create a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">queue</span>”</span> element
      and put this in as part of the pipeline. <span class="application">GStreamer</span> will take care of
      all threading details internally.
