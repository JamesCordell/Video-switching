      Many people have expressed the wish to use their own sources to inject
      data into a pipeline. Some people have also expressed the wish to grab
      the output in a pipeline and take care of the actual output inside
      their application. While either of these methods are strongly
      discouraged, <span class="application">GStreamer</span> offers support for this.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Beware! You need to know what you are doing.</em></span> Since
      you don't have any support from a base class you need to thoroughly
      understand state changes and synchronization. If it doesn't work,
      there are a million ways to shoot yourself in the foot.  It's always
      better to simply write a plugin and have the base class manage it.
      See the Plugin Writer's Guide for more information on this topic. Also
      see the next section, which will explain how to embed plugins statically
      in your application.
    </p><p>
      There's two possible elements that you can use for the above-mentioned
      purposes. Those are called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">appsrc</span>”</span> (an imaginary source)
      and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">appsink</span>”</span> (an imaginary sink). The same method applies
      to each of those elements. Here, we will discuss how to use those
      elements to insert (using appsrc) or grab (using appsink) data from a
      pipeline, and how to set negotiation.
    </p><p>
      Both appsrc and appsink provide 2 sets of API. One API uses standard
      GObject (action) signals and properties. The same API is also
      available as a regular C api. The C api is more performant but
      requires you to link to the app library in order to use the elements.
    </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-spoof-appsrc"></a>Inserting data with appsrc</h3></div></div></div><p>
        First we look at some examples for appsrc, which lets you insert data
        into the pipeline from the application. Appsrc has some configuration
        options that define how it will operate. You should decide about the
        following configurations:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            Will the appsrc operate in push or pull mode. The stream-type
            property can be used to control this. stream-type of
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">random-access</span>”</span> will activate pull mode scheduling
            while the other stream-types activate push mode.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The caps of the buffers that appsrc will push out. This needs to
            be configured with the caps property. The caps must be set to a
            fixed caps and will be used to negotiate a format downstream.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If the appsrc operates in live mode or not. This can be configured
            with the is-live property. When operating in live-mode it is
            important to configure the min-latency and max-latency in appsrc.
            The min-latency should be set to the amount of time it takes between
            capturing a buffer and when it is pushed inside appsrc.
            In live mode, you should timestamp the buffers with the pipeline
            running-time when the first byte of the buffer was captured before
            feeding them to appsrc. You can let appsrc do the timestaping with
            the do-timestamp property (but then the min-latency must be set
            to 0 because it timestamps based on the running-time when the buffer
            entered appsrc).
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The format of the SEGMENT event that appsrc will push. The format
            has implications for how the running-time of the buffers will
            be calculated so you must be sure you understand this. For
            live sources you probably want to set the format property to
            GST_FORMAT_TIME. For non-live source it depends on the media type
            that you are handling. If you plan to timestamp the buffers, you
            should probably put a GST_FORMAT_TIME format, otherwise
            GST_FORMAT_BYTES might be appropriate.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If appsrc operates in random-access mode, it is important to configure
            the size property of appsrc with the number of bytes in the stream.
            This will allow downstream elements to know the size of the media and
            alows them to seek to the end of the stream when needed.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        The main way of handling data to appsrc is by using the function
        <code class="function">gst_app_src_push_buffer ()</code> or by emiting the
        push-buffer action signal.  This will put the buffer onto a queue from
        which appsrc will read from in its streaming thread. It is important
        to note that data transport will not happen from the thread that
        performed the push-buffer call.
      </p><p>
        The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">max-bytes</span>”</span> property controls how much data can be
        queued in appsrc before appsrc considers the queue full. A filled
        internal queue will always signal the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">enough-data</span>”</span>
        signal, which signals the application that it should stop pushing
        data into appsrc. The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">block</span>”</span> property will cause appsrc to
        block the push-buffer method until free data becomes available again.
      </p><p>
        When the internal queue is running out of data, the
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">need-data</span>”</span> signal is emitted, which signals the application
        that it should start pushing more data into appsrc.
      </p><p>
        In addition to the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">need-data</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">enough-data</span>”</span>
        signals, appsrc can emit the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">seek-data</span>”</span> signal when the
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">stream-mode</span>”</span> property is set to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">seekable</span>”</span>
        or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">random-access</span>”</span>. The signal argument will contain the
        new desired position in the stream expressed in the unit set with the
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">format</span>”</span> property. After receiving the seek-data signal,
        the application should push-buffers from the new position.
      </p><p>
        When the last byte is pushed into appsrc, you must call
        <code class="function">gst_app_src_end_of_stream ()</code> to make it send
        an EOS downstream.
      </p><p>
        These signals allow the application to operate appsrc in push and
        pull mode as will be explained next.
      </p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="section-spoof-appsrc-push"></a>Using appsrc in push mode</h4></div></div></div><p>
          When appsrc is configured in push mode (stream-type is stream or
          seekable), the application repeatedly calls the push-buffer method
          with a new buffer. Optionally, the queue size in the appsrc can be
          controlled with the enough-data and need-data signals by respectively
          stopping/starting the push-buffer calls. The value of the
          min-percent property defines how empty the internal appsrc queue
          needs to be before the need-data signal will be fired. You can set
          this to some value &gt;0 to avoid completely draining the queue.
        </p><p>
          When the stream-type is set to seekable, don't forget to implement
          a seek-data callback.
        </p><p>
          Use this model when implementing various network protocols or
          hardware devices.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="section-spoof-appsrc-pull"></a>Using appsrc in pull mode</h4></div></div></div><p>
          In the pull model, data is fed to appsrc from the need-data signal
          handler. You should push exactly the amount of bytes requested in the
          need-data signal. You are only allowed to push less bytes when you are
          at the end of the stream.
        </p><p>
          Use this model for file access or other randomly accessable sources.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="section-spoof-appsrc-ex"></a>Appsrc example</h4></div></div></div><p>
          This example application will generate black/white (it switches
          every second) video to an Xv-window output by using appsrc as a
          source with caps to force a format. We use a colorspace
          conversion element to make sure that we feed the right format to
          your X server. We configure a video stream with a variable framerate
          (0/1) and we set the timestamps on the outgoing buffers in such
          a way that we play 2 frames per second.
        </p><p>
          Note how we use the pull mode method of pushing new buffers into
          appsrc although appsrc is running in push mode.

        Unlike appsrc, appsink is a little easier to use. It also supports
        a pull and push based model of getting data from the pipeline.
      </p><p>
        The normal way of retrieving samples from appsink is by using the
        <code class="function">gst_app_sink_pull_sample()</code> and
        <code class="function">gst_app_sink_pull_preroll()</code> methods or by using
        the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pull-sample</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pull-preroll</span>”</span>
        signals.  These methods block until a sample becomes available in the
        sink or when the sink is shut down or reaches EOS.
      </p><p>
        Appsink will internally use a queue to collect buffers from the
        streaming thread. If the application is not pulling samples fast
        enough, this queue will consume a lot of memory over time. The
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">max-buffers</span>”</span> property can be used to limit the queue
        size. The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">drop</span>”</span> property controls whether the
        streaming thread blocks or if older buffers are dropped when the
        maximum queue size is reached. Note that blocking the streaming thread
        can negatively affect real-time performance and should be avoided.
      </p><p>
        If a blocking behaviour is not desirable, setting the 
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">emit-signals</span>”</span> property to TRUE will make appsink emit
        the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">new-sample</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">new-preroll</span>”</span> signals
        when a sample can be pulled without blocking.
      </p><p>
        The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">caps</span>”</span> property on appsink can be used to control
        the formats that appsink can receive. This property can contain
        non-fixed caps, the format of the pulled samples can be obtained by
        getting the sample caps.
      </p><p>
        If one of the pull-preroll or pull-sample methods return NULL, the
        appsink is stopped or in the EOS state. You can check for the EOS state
        with the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">eos</span>”</span> property or with the
        <code class="function">gst_app_sink_is_eos()</code> method.
      </p><p>
        The eos signal can also be used to be informed when the EOS state is
        reached to avoid polling.
      </p><p>
        Consider configuring the following properties in the appsink:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">sync</span>”</span> property if you want to have the sink
            base class synchronize the buffer against the pipeline clock
            before handing you the sample.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Enable Quality-of-Service with the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">qos</span>”</span> property.
            If you are dealing with raw video frames and let the base class
            sycnhronize on the clock, it might be a good idea to also let
            the base class send QOS events upstream.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The caps property that contains the accepted caps. Upstream elements
            will try to convert the format so that it matches the configured
            caps on appsink. You must still check the
            <code class="classname">GstSample</code> to get the actual caps of the
            buffer.
