      After being created, an element will not actually perform any actions
      yet. You need to change elements state to make it do something.
      <span class="application">GStreamer</span> knows four element states, each with a very specific
      meaning. Those four states are:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          <code class="classname">GST_STATE_NULL</code>: this is the default state.
          No resources are allocated in this state, so, transitioning to it
          will free all resources. The element must be in this state when
          its refcount reaches 0 and it is freed.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          <code class="classname">GST_STATE_READY</code>: in the ready state, an
          element has allocated all of its global resources, that is,
          resources that can be kept within streams. You can think about
          opening devices, allocating buffers and so on. However, the
          stream is not opened in this state, so the stream positions is
          automatically zero. If a stream was previously opened, it should
          be closed in this state, and position, properties and such should
          be reset.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          <code class="classname">GST_STATE_PAUSED</code>: in this state, an
          element has opened the stream, but is not actively processing
          it. An element is allowed to modify a stream's position, read
          and process data and such to prepare for playback as soon as
          state is changed to PLAYING, but it is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
          allowed to play the data which would make the clock run.
          In summary, PAUSED is the same as PLAYING but without a running
          clock.
         </p><p>
          Elements going into the PAUSED state should prepare themselves
          for moving over to the PLAYING state as soon as possible. Video
          or audio outputs would, for example, wait for data to arrive and
          queue it so they can play it right after the state change. Also,
          video sinks can already play the first frame (since this does
          not affect the clock yet). Autopluggers could use this same
          state transition to already plug together a pipeline. Most other
          elements, such as codecs or filters, do not need to explicitly
          do anything in this state, however.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          <code class="classname">GST_STATE_PLAYING</code>: in the PLAYING state,
          an element does exactly the same as in the PAUSED state, except
          that the clock now runs.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      You can change the state of an element using the function
      <code class="function">gst_element_set_state ()</code>. If you set an element
      to another state, <span class="application">GStreamer</span> will internally traverse all intermediate
      states. So if you set an element from NULL to PLAYING, <span class="application">GStreamer</span>
      will internally set the element to READY and PAUSED in between.
    </p><p>
      When moved to <code class="classname">GST_STATE_PLAYING</code>, pipelines
      will process data automatically. They do not need to be iterated in
      any form. Internally, <span class="application">GStreamer</span> will start threads that take this
      task on to them. <span class="application">GStreamer</span> will also take care of switching
      messages from the pipeline's thread into the application's own
      thread, by using a <a class="ulink" href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/stable/gstreamer/html/GstBus.html" target="_top"><code class="classname">GstBus</code></a>. See
      <a class="xref" href="chapter-bus.html" title="Chapter 7. Bus">Chapter 7, <i>Bus</i></a> for details.
    </p><p>
      When you set a bin or pipeline to a certain target state, it will usually
      propagate the state change to all elements within the bin or pipeline
      automatically, so it's usually only necessary to set the state of the
      top-level pipeline to start up the pipeline or shut it down. However,
      when adding elements dynamically to an already-running pipeline, e.g.
      from within a "pad-added" signal callback, you
      need to set it to the desired target state yourself using
      <code class="function">gst_element_set_state ()</code> or
      <code class="function">gst_element_sync_state_with_parent ()</code>.
