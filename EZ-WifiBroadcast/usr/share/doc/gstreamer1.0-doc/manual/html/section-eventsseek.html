      Events work in a very similar way as queries. Dispatching, for
      example, works exactly the same for events (and also has the same
      limitations), and they can similarly be sent to the toplevel pipeline
      and it will figure out everything for you. Although there are more
      ways in which applications and elements can interact using events,
      we will only focus on seeking here. This is done using the seek-event.
      A seek-event contains a playback rate, a seek offset format (which is
      the unit of the offsets to follow, e.g. time, audio samples, video
      frames or bytes), optionally a set of seeking-related flags (e.g.
      whether internal buffers should be flushed), a seek method (which
      indicates relative to what the offset was given), and seek offsets.
      The first offset (cur) is the new position to seek to, while
      the second offset (stop) is optional and specifies a position where
      streaming is supposed to stop. Usually it is fine to just specify
      GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE and -1 as end_method and end offset. The behaviour
      of a seek is also wrapped in the <code class="function">gst_element_seek ()</code>.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
static void
seek_to_time (GstElement *pipeline,
	      gint64      time_nanoseconds)
{
  if (!gst_element_seek (pipeline, 1.0, GST_FORMAT_TIME, GST_SEEK_FLAG_FLUSH,
                         GST_SEEK_TYPE_SET, time_nanoseconds,
                         GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE, GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE)) {
    g_print ("Seek failed!\n");
  }
}
    </pre><p>
      Seeks with the GST_SEEK_FLAG_FLUSH should be done when the pipeline is
      in PAUSED or PLAYING state. The pipeline will automatically go to preroll
      state until the new data after the seek will cause the pipeline to preroll
      again. After the pipeline is prerolled, it will go back to the state
      (PAUSED or PLAYING) it was in when the seek was executed. You can wait
      (blocking) for the seek to complete with
      <code class="function">gst_element_get_state()</code> or by waiting for the
      ASYNC_DONE message to appear on the bus.
    </p><p>
      Seeks without the GST_SEEK_FLAG_FLUSH should only be done when the
      pipeline is in the PLAYING state. Executing a non-flushing seek in the
      PAUSED state might deadlock because the pipeline streaming threads might
      be blocked in the sinks.
    </p><p>
      It is important to realise that seeks will not happen instantly in the
      sense that they are finished when the function
      <code class="function">gst_element_seek ()</code> returns. Depending on the
      specific elements involved, the actual seeking might be done later in
      another thread (the streaming thread), and it might take a short time
      until buffers from the new seek position will reach downstream elements
      such as sinks (if the seek was non-flushing then it might take a bit
      longer).
    </p><p>
      It is possible to do multiple seeks in short time-intervals, such as
      a direct response to slider movement. After a seek, internally, the
      pipeline will be paused (if it was playing), the position will be
      re-set internally, the demuxers and decoders will decode from the new
      position onwards and this will continue until all sinks have data
      again. If it was playing originally, it will be set to playing again,
      too. Since the new position is immediately available in a video output,
      you will see the new frame, even if your pipeline is not in the playing
      state.
