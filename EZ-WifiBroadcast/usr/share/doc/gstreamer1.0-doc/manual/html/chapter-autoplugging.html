    In <a class="xref" href="chapter-helloworld.html" title="Chapter 10. Your first application">Chapter 10, <i>Your first application</i></a>, you've learned to build a
    simple media player for Ogg/Vorbis files. By using alternative elements,
    you are able to build media players for other media types, such as
    Ogg/Speex, MP3 or even video formats. However, you would rather want
    to build an application that can automatically detect the media type
    of a stream and automatically generate the best possible pipeline
    by looking at all available elements in a system. This process is called
    autoplugging, and <span class="application">GStreamer</span> contains high-quality autopluggers. If
    you're looking for an autoplugger, don't read any further and go to
    <a class="xref" href="chapter-playback-components.html" title="Chapter 20. Playback Components">Chapter 20, <i>Playback Components</i></a>. This chapter will explain the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>concept</em></span> of autoplugging and typefinding. It will
    explain what systems <span class="application">GStreamer</span> includes to dynamically detect the
    type of a media stream, and how to generate a pipeline of decoder
    elements to playback this media. The same principles can also be used
    for transcoding. Because of the full dynamicity of this concept,
    <span class="application">GStreamer</span> can be automatically extended to support new media types
    without needing any adaptations to its autopluggers.
  </p><p>
    We will first introduce the concept of Media types as a dynamic and
    extendible way of identifying media streams. After that, we will introduce
    the concept of typefinding to find the type of a media stream. Lastly,
    we will explain how autoplugging and the <span class="application">GStreamer</span> registry can be
    used to setup a pipeline that will convert media from one mediatype to
    another, for example for media decoding.

      We have previously introduced the concept of capabilities as a way
      for elements (or, rather, pads) to agree on a media type when
      streaming data from one element to the next (see <a class="xref" href="section-caps.html" title="Capabilities of a pad">the section called “Capabilities of a pad”</a>). We have explained that a capability is
      a combination of a media type and a set of properties. For most
      container formats (those are the files that you will find on your
      hard disk; Ogg, for example, is a container format), no properties
      are needed to describe the stream. Only a media type is needed. A
      full list of media types and accompanying properties can be found
      in <a class="ulink" href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/pwg/html/section-types-definitions.html" target="_top">the
      Plugin Writer's Guide</a>.
    </p><p>
      An element must associate a media type to its source and sink pads
      when it is loaded into the system. <span class="application">GStreamer</span> knows about the
      different elements and what type of data they expect and emit through
      the <span class="application">GStreamer</span> registry. This allows for very dynamic and extensible
      element creation as we will see.
    </p><p>
      In <a class="xref" href="chapter-helloworld.html" title="Chapter 10. Your first application">Chapter 10, <i>Your first application</i></a>, we've learned to build a
      music player for Ogg/Vorbis files. Let's look at the media types
      associated with each pad in this pipeline. <a class="xref" href="chapter-autoplugging.html#section-mime-img" title="Figure 18.1. The Hello world pipeline with media types">Figure 18.1, “The Hello world pipeline with media types”</a> shows what media type belongs to each
      pad in this pipeline.
    </p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a name="section-mime-img"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 18.1. The Hello world pipeline with media types</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/mime-world.png" width="405" alt="The Hello world pipeline with media types"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"></div><p>
      Now that we have an idea how <span class="application">GStreamer</span> identifies known media
      streams, we can look at methods <span class="application">GStreamer</span> uses to setup pipelines
      for media handling and for media type detection.
