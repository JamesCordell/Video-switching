    The purpose of buffering is to accumulate enough data in a pipeline so that
    playback can occur smoothly and without interruptions. It is typically done
    when reading from a (slow) and non-live network source but can also be
    used for live sources.
  </p><p>
    <span class="application">GStreamer</span> provides support for the following use cases:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          Buffering up to a specific amount of data, in memory, before starting
          playback so that network fluctuations are minimized.
          See <a class="xref" href="chapter-buffering.html#section-buffering-stream" title="Stream buffering">the section called “Stream buffering ”</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Download of the network file to a local disk with fast seeking in the
          downloaded data. This is similar to the quicktime/youtube players.
          See <a class="xref" href="section-buffering-download.html" title="Download buffering">the section called “Download buffering ”</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Caching of (semi)-live streams to a local, on disk, ringbuffer with
          seeking in the cached area. This is similar to tivo-like timeshifting.
          See <a class="xref" href="section-buffering-timeshift.html" title="Timeshift buffering">the section called “Timeshift buffering ”</a>.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    <span class="application">GStreamer</span> can provide the application with progress reports about the
    current buffering state as well as let the application decide on how
    to buffer and when the buffering stops.
  </p><p>
    In the most simple case, the application has to listen for BUFFERING
    messages on the bus. If the percent indicator inside the BUFFERING message
    is smaller than 100, the pipeline is buffering. When a message is
    received with 100 percent, buffering is complete. In the buffering state,
    the application should keep the pipeline in the PAUSED state. When buffering
    completes, it can put the pipeline (back) in the PLAYING state.
  </p><p>
    What follows is an example of how the message handler could deal with
    the BUFFERING messages. We will see more advanced methods in
    <a class="xref" href="section-buffering-strategies.html" title="Buffering strategies">the section called “Buffering strategies ”</a>.

        break;

      In this case we are reading from a slow network source into a buffer
      element (such as queue2).
    </p><p>
      The buffer element has a low and high watermark expressed in bytes. The
      buffer uses the watermarks as follows:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          The buffer element will post BUFFERING messages until the high
          watermark is hit. This instructs the application to keep the pipeline
          PAUSED, which will eventually block the srcpad from pushing while
          data is prerolled in the sinks.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          When the high watermark is hit, a BUFFERING message with 100% will be
          posted, which instructs the application to continue playback.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          When during playback, the low watermark is hit, the queue will start
          posting BUFFERING messages again, making the application PAUSE the
          pipeline again until the high watermark is hit again. This is called
          the rebuffering stage.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          During playback, the queue level will fluctuate between the high and
          the low watermark as a way to compensate for network irregularities.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
     This buffering method is usable when the demuxer operates in push mode.
     Seeking in the stream requires the seek to happen in the network source.
     It is mostly desirable when the total duration of the file is not known,
     such as in live streaming or when efficient seeking is not
     possible/required.
   </p><p>
     The problem is configuring a good low and high watermark. Here are some
     ideas:
   </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          It is possible to measure the network bandwidth and configure the
          low/high watermarks in such a way that buffering takes a fixed
          amount of time.
        </p><p>
          The queue2 element in <span class="application">GStreamer</span> core has the max-size-time property
          that, together with the use-rate-estimate property, does exactly
          that. Also the playbin buffer-duration property uses the rate estimate
          to scale the amount of data that is buffered.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Based on the codec bitrate, it is also possible to set the watermarks
          in such a way that a fixed amount of data is buffered before playback
          starts. Normally, the buffering element doesn't know about the
          bitrate of the stream but it can get this with a query.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Start with a fixed amount of bytes, measure the time between
          rebuffering and increase the queue size until the time between
          rebuffering is within the application's chosen limits.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
     The buffering element can be inserted anywhere in the pipeline. You could,
     for example, insert the buffering element before a decoder. This would
     make it possible to set the low/high watermarks based on time.
   </p><p>
     The buffering flag on playbin, performs buffering on the parsed data.
     Another advantage of doing the buffering at a later stage is that you can
     let the demuxer operate in pull mode. When reading data from a slow
     network drive (with filesrc) this can be an interesting way to buffer.
