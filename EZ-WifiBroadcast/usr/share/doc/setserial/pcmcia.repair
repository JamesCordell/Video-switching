If you have been using setserial versions 2.15-1 to 2.15-6, and you have
been having problems with setserial taking over your pcmcia serial/modem
devices, then read on... Otherwise stop reading now, as NONE OF THIS APPLIES
TO YOU.

At of 2.15-1, setserial searches for serial device configuration on
shutdown or halt, and stores it in /etc/serial.conf. The state is
then automatically loaded on a reboot. This includes pcmcia devices,
which are not managed by setserial but by pcmcia-cs.

As of 2.15-7, setserial does not save the state of pcmcia devices. If you
really do want it to control pcmcia ports, you will have to switch off
the AUTOSAVE ability, and do it by hand.

However, if you used 2.15-1 to 2.15-6, the pcmcia devices will already be
in /etc/serial.conf, and although setserial tries to sort out the problem
automatically when you upgrade, you may feel you want to do some tidying up...

(1) make sure that your pcmcia cards are inserted and configured.
(2) su root
(3) /etc/init.d/setserial stop
    hopefully, some messages will appear informing you that pcmcia filtering
    is going on.
(4) Look in your /etc/serial.conf. A two-port standard setup should look
    something like:

###AUTOSAVE###
/dev/ttyS0 uart 16550A port 0x03f8 irq 4 spd_normal skip_test session_lockout
/dev/ttyS1 uart 16550A port 0x02f8 irq 3 spd_normal skip_test session_lockout

    If you have only one non-pcmcia port, then you should have only
    /dev/ttyS0. Most desktop computers have two ports.
(5) If you see a device (eg /dev/ttyS2) which is not one of your non-pcmcia
    serial ports, run "setserial /dev/ttyS2 uart unknown" to delete it. Do
    not bother to edit the serial.conf file. Instead, run 
    /etc/init.d/setserial stop
    Check the file. If everything is ok, you can try a 
    /etc/init.d/setserial start
    No error messages - you are in the clear.
